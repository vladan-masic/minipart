            <h2 class="h2-about-project-left">SHORT PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The intensive development in mining regions leads to substantial and predominantly negative changes in the local community and its environment (mono-functional economy; environmental degradation; relocation).<br>Resistance from the community and experts towards mining activities in Serbia has intensified since the 2000s, increasing the significance of public participation in the planning of mining areas.
                MINIPART is designed as a research project that combines qualitative and quantitative research methods to create the most suitable methods for public participation in mining regions, including vulnerable groups. These defined methods will facilitate and motivate the participation of all stakeholders in planning, reduce conflicts, and enable the balancing of the needs of citizens, industry, and government, not only in mining regions but elsewhere as well.</p>
                <p>Project duration: 2024-01-03 - 2027-01-02.</p>

            <br>
            <p>The main objective of MINIPART is to identify the most appropriate participation methods, tailored to all stakeholders in mining areas. These methods will provide the most efficient means for stakeholders to influence decision-making, thereby enhancing their quality of work and life (social, environmental, economic) and ensuring sustainable development.<br><br>
                The specific objectives:<br>
                (1) To compile a comprehensive repository of available examples of participatory planning in mining areas.<br>
                (2) To engage all stakeholders (citizens, mining industry, government, NGOs, environmentalists) actively in the identification of the best participatory methods through interviews, surveys, and focus groups.<br>
                (3) To address the specific needs of vulnerable groups (women, ethnic minorities, rural populations, persons with disabilities, the elderly, and youth) in the process of identifying the most suitable participatory methods.<br>
                (4) To develop new or adapted approaches for meaningful and inclusive community participation in mining planning and development.<br>
                (5) To widely disseminate the results to all project participants, the national and local governmental sectors, the NGO sector, citizens in Serbia and abroad, academia, professionals, and the general public.</p>
